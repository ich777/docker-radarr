# Radarr in Docker optimized for Unraid
Radarr A fork of Sonarr to work with movies à la Couchpotato.

**Update:** The container will check on every start/restart if there is a newer version available (you can also choose between stabel and nightly version - keep in mind that switching from a stable to a nightly version and vice versa will/can break the container).

**Manual Version:** You can also set a version manually by typing in the version number that you want to use for example: '0.2.0.1480' (without quotes) - you can also change it to 'latest' or 'nightly' like described above (works only for stable builds - don't forget to disable updates in the WebGUI if you are using a specific version).

**ATTENTION:** Don't change the port in the Radarr config itself.

**Migration:** If you are migrating from another Container please be sure to deltete the files/folders 'logs', 'xdg' and 'config.xml', don't forget to change the root folder for your movies and select 'No, I'll Move the Files Myself'!

#### **WARNING:** The main configuration of the paths has a performance and disk usage impact: **slow, I/O intensive moves and wasted disk space**. For a detailed guide to change that see https://trash-guides.info/hardlinks/#unraid .
